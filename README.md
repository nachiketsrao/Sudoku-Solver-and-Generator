# Sudoku-Solver-and-Generator
This is a sudoku solver and generator with GUI built using Python

**ALGORITHM:**

The solver uses the Recursive Backtracking Algorithm. Backtracking is a form of search that climbs recursively down a tree made of different choices. Whenever a backtracking algorithm is used, its goal is to reach the very end of its recursion tree where the solutions are, so in order to reach the end it will have to search its way down along a valid path.
